# OPEN_ITEMS.md — what is missing, and what is deliberately not

Two kinds of thing live here, and they are kept apart on purpose:

1. **Out of scope** — decided or impossible, recorded so nobody re-litigates
   it, and the first section below because it is the thing a session most
   needs to know before starting work on a format.
2. **Open items** — a standing audit of the gaps: things not done, things done
   but not verified, and things this repository asserts more confidently than
   the evidence supports. Each says what would close it.

**Not** BLOCKERS.md, which records investigations that went wrong and the
claims withdrawn from them. Nothing here stops the engine or the CLI, which are
byte-exact against the oracle across 932 fixtures in `./ci.sh`.

Detail lives in one place per finding — status in BLOCKERS.md, reasoning in
DECISIONS.md, how to re-run in TESTING.md or `tools/vmac/README.md`, what needs
real hardware in MANUAL_TESTS.md, results in FORMATS.md — and is
cross-referenced from here rather than repeated.

**Filing something here is a decision to stop looking at it, so it had
better be true.**

**Only OPEN items live in part 2.** A closed one moves out rather than being
annotated: the lesson to DECISIONS.md, the withdrawn claim to BLOCKERS.md,
the numbers to FORMATS.md. A section that empties is the point of the file.

# Part 1 — Out of scope for v1

**Decided, or impossible. Not open.** Everything here is either a boundary
somebody chose or a property of a format that no evidence can change; nothing
here is closed by finding a file, and what is waiting for one is Part 2's
*"Waiting on a file this machine does not have"*. "Out of scope" is today's
answer and not a refusal — the brief has grown before, on request.

## Out by the brief

| what | status | why it stays out |
|---|---|---|
| Compression | not implemented | this is an extractor |
| StuffIt X (`.sitx`) | **detect-only** | out by the brief |
| PKWARE "strong encryption" in a zip (flag 0x40) | **named, refused per entry** | its key material is in a record nothing here parses, and XADMaster refuses it too. Every OTHER encryption these formats have is decrypted, including WinZip's AES (FORMATS.md, *Encryption*) |
| Disk images (`.image`, `.img`, `.iso`, `.cdr`, `.toast`, `.dmg`, `.smi`), and Disk Copy 4.2 | **not recognised**, and not extracted | extracting one means a filesystem rather than a codec, and naming one is worth nothing either: a disk image is not an archive, so the name leaves a user exactly where "not recognized" does. The probes are complete, graded and kept in `attic/` (DECISIONS.md 2026-08-26, *read the volume, not the extension*) |
| PMarc (`-pm0-`, `-pm1-`, `-pm2-`) and `-lhx-` | **not recognised** | a different family behind an LZH-shaped header. PMarc is a Japanese PC format with its own coders, `-lhx-` is UNLHA32's extension; neither reached a Macintosh |
| Self-extracting LZH (an executable with an archive behind it) | **not recognised** | the archive sits behind DOS, Amiga, Atari or X68000 machine code, and finding it means knowing each of those loaders. `unar` has a parser per platform; here the answer is to hand the `.lzh` itself to the extractor |
| RAR, 7z, bzip2, xz, Cabinet, Zoo, ar/`.deb`, cpio, ARJ | **named, never extracted** | none is a Macintosh archive format, none carries a resource fork or Finder metadata, and every one is served by a maintained extractor on any machine that can run one. NAMING them is in scope (DECISIONS.md 2026-08-26, *a name is only worth something inside the frame the user came with*; FORMATS.md, *Archives named but not extracted*) |
| Alysis SuperDisk! method 13 | **not implemented, and no specimen is wanted** | its module compresses and REFUSES to decompress — `_Debugger` at its own 0xd4 — so no Alysis expander in reach can read what it writes, and nor can this engine or any other module in the library. Streams can be made here at will and there is nothing whatever to grade one against. It is reachable from Alysis's own compress path (level 11 of INIT 32's table at +0xf2e), so a file COULD exist; reading one would mean inverting that compressor with no second reader anywhere, for a codec no archive in the corpus uses (FORMATS.md, *Module 13*; DECISIONS.md 2026-08-29, *the specimen that would have settled nothing*) |
| Zip64 addressing past 4 GB | **the counts and the per-ENTRY escape are read; over-4-GB fields are refused** — `UNC_ERR_UNSUPPORTED` per archive, `UNC_ERR_TOOLARGE` per entry — and `unc_zipseg_describe` still answers `UNC_ERR_UNSUPPORTED` for a spanned set | zip's own shape is what keeps it out: the directory fields are 32-bit and the Zip64 escape is read as `uint32` halves, so reading past 4 GB properly is a format change rather than a type change. The type is not the obstacle — `UncIO` carries `unc_off_t`, 64-bit in the CLI, for +0.51 % of text and 0 bytes of heap (DECISIONS.md 2026-08-28, *what a width costs*). Reading the halves is what makes a 70,000-entry archive extract, and a 3.4 GB one (FORMATS.md, *Size limits*); tar, whose positions are a running sum, reaches past 4 GB today |

Everything detect-only is **named** by `unc_sniff`, and both front ends say
the name: the CLI prints *"recognized as RAR, which v1 cannot extract"* and
the Macintosh application's alert reads *"MacExtract cannot open RAR files."*
(photographed on System 6.0.8). Extraction returns cleanly unsupported either
way.

## Limits of the formats themselves

- **A raw brotli stream cannot be identified, by this or any program.** RFC
  7932 section 9.1 is its entire stream header: one to seven bits of WBITS,
  and nothing else. No magic number, no signature, no version byte, no
  length. So `unc_sniff` will never name a `.br`, and the reason is the
  format rather than a missing reference. **What would change it:** nothing
  in the format. A host that trusts the filename could act on `.br`, which
  is a naming question and not an identifying one.
  `reference/notes/brotli_rfc7932.txt` is kept as the evidence for a
  negative.

- **A cut tar cannot be noticed, by this or any program.** A tar has no
  directory, no entry count and no length of its own, so a file that
  stops after five members reads exactly as a tar with five members. The
  two 512-byte zero blocks that POSIX ends an archive with would be the
  evidence — and they are not reliably there: `derived-popper-1.7.tar`,
  a real corpus archive, ends with **zero** trailing zero bytes, so
  requiring them would call it truncated. `unar` accepts a cut tar too.
  Every other format in the corpus notices a cut at three sampled cut
  points (`tools/run_truncation.py`, in `ci.sh`). **What would change
  it:** nothing in the format. A host that knows what the download was
  SUPPOSED to weigh could compare, which is a question about the
  transfer and not about the archive.

- **One 46-byte window of a DiskDoubler DDA2 archive is ambiguous.** A
  DDA2 archive normally ends with a 0xBBBB record, and a walk that never
  reaches one is reported truncated — except that an archive may
  legitimately end without it, leaving fewer than the 46 bytes one record
  needs after its last entry. `derived-DD_Expand.sea` ends exactly so and
  `unar` reads it, so a cut that lands in that same window is
  byte-for-byte a valid ending; `ddtf-ddpro411dd3.dd` cut to a fifth is
  the measured case, and every other cut point in the corpus is caught.
  **What would change it:** nothing in the format — the two files are
  identical there. The rule that tries is DECISIONS.md 2026-08-29, *a cut
  archive*.

- **Two folders that merge cannot be told from one folder visited
  twice, in a format that carries no directory entries.** The Macintosh
  shell shortens every path component to 31 characters, so two folders
  whose names agree that far become one; where the archive declares each
  folder as an entry of its own (DiskDoubler, SuperDisk!, StuffIt
  hierarchies) that is reported as *"combined with"*, because the
  declaration is what makes the second one distinguishable. Where
  folders exist only inside the paths of the files in them, the second
  arrival looks exactly like the first folder being revisited.
  **What would change it:** nothing in the format. Remembering every
  long name ever seen would, at a cost this shell will not pay on a
  1 MB machine — it remembers 24 (FORMATS.md, *Name limits*).

- **A uuencoded set missing a MIDDLE part decodes short, and silently.** A
  document posted in several parts joins and decodes — the mail headers
  between parts are stepped over — but uuencode carries no length and no
  checksum anywhere, so nothing can notice that a part never arrived. A
  missing LAST part IS caught: the terminator and `end` live there. Asserted
  rather than described — `tools/run_uu.py` builds a gapped set and requires
  exactly this result, so the day the format turns out to have a check, the
  suite says so. **What would change it:** nothing in the format. A host that
  knows the parts were numbered `1/5` could check the count, which is a naming
  question and not a decoding one.

## Waiting on a file this machine does not have

**Not scope decisions, and not effort.** Everything here is written or
writeable; what is missing is something to grade it against. They sit together
across formats because that is how they close — by somebody finding a file,
and the finding usually arrives from outside the format it settles. The
question to bring here is *what did I just find?*

Each says which of the two is missing, because the searches are different:

- a **reference** — a spec, an implementation, or a self-extracting specimen,
  which is one; rule #1 forbids writing a format without it;
- a **gradeable specimen** — a file written by something else, so our output
  has something to be wrong against.

None of this is impossible here: a download would do it.

**Four questions before filing anything here**, each of which has emptied this
section at least once: is there an implementation that could be **FED**
(DECISIONS.md, methods 3, 4 and 5); is *"X does not survive"* a claim about
somebody's **search** (BLOCKERS.md, SuperDisk!'s compressor); does the search
name the **right tool** (BLOCKERS.md 2026-08-25); and **have you looked at
all** (BLOCKERS.md, the ARC 7 row, filed and disproved the same day).

- **Apple Archive (`.aar`) is unnamed for want of a reference.** Extraction
  is out of scope either way. Missing: a **reference** — an implementation
  or spec in `reference/`.

- **A SpaceSaver file written by SpaceSaver.** Every codec is graded against
  Aladdin's own modules (FORMATS.md, *StuffIt SpaceSaver*), so what rests on
  this is the CONTAINER: the method the application picks for its CPU, the
  data fork's length rounded up to 256 bytes, the 84-byte header, and the
  type, creator and Finder flags it moves aside — all currently read from
  containers this project builds itself. **Nothing here can make the
  application compress anything**; about twenty emulator runs are accounted
  for in BLOCKERS.md, and the request now sits in MANUAL_TESTS.md §6.
  Missing: a **gradeable specimen** — one SpaceSaver file, with the original
  beside it.

- **AppleLink `.pkg`: one file, which would settle two questions.**
  Named from Aladdin's own recogniser (FORMATS.md, *AppleLink packages*),
  and detect-only because nothing here can grade a decoder. Three measured
  things suggest there is nothing to decode — that a package is a transfer
  manifest naming files beside it rather than a container — in which case
  this closes as a property of the format (DECISIONS.md 2026-08-23,
  *AppleLink `.pkg`, named at last*). Missing: a **gradeable specimen**,
  which answers both.

---

## Untested code, named so it is not mistaken for tested

- **SuperDisk! reaches the path cap through code that is tested, in a
  container nothing here writes.** `unc_path_leaf` keeps the uncut path
  (DECISIONS.md 2026-08-27, *the path builder's own cap*), and
  `tools/run_names.py` grades it on generated Now Compress and
  DiskDoubler trees against `unar`. SuperDisk! runs that same helper and
  walks folders in both its fixtures, up-directory record included; what
  no fixture has is a path that SUMS past 255 bytes, so its own header
  walk has never been the thing that reached the cap. **What would close
  it:** a SuperDisk! archive nested deep enough. A generated record
  stream would not: nothing off the Macintosh reads this container, so it
  could only be graded against the same transcription that wrote it. The
  one second reader that exists is an archive's own self-extractor on an
  emulated Mac, which has never been handed a stream this project
  wrote.
