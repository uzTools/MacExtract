# ---- the code ceiling -------------------------------------------------------
#
# CODE is the only part of this application that costs the engine anything.
# Measured 2026-08-30 by ballast, on a 1 MB Mac Plus under System 6.0.8, with
# the ballast VERIFIED present in the binary that ran (three earlier attempts
# measured nothing because --gc-sections had dropped it, or because it sat in
# the other main):
#
#   +11,308 B of code  -> FreeMem 647,096 -> 635,768   (1:1)
#   + 6,132 B of .data -> FreeMem 647,096 -> 647,096   (free)
#
# CODE resources are handles INSIDE the heap FreeMem() reports; the A5 global
# world is outside it. So tables, strings and globals are free, and every byte
# of compiled code comes off every extraction:
#
#   budget = 708,100 - code        (autotest build, 1 MB, System 6.0.8)
#
# This is a RATCHET, not a budget. It is set at the code size on the day it
# was introduced, so growth has to be a decision rather than an accident:
# raise it deliberately, knowing that each byte is a byte off the budget on
# the smallest supported machine. Between 2026-08-24 and 2026-08-30 code grew
# ~32,000 B unnoticed, the budget fell from 597,036 to 565,176, and three
# corpus archives stopped fitting on a 1 MB Mac Plus with nothing failing.
# That is what this is here to stop happening again.
# Raised 2026-08-31 from 147,268 to 147,296: +16 B for the memory message
# that depends on whether there is a partition to grow, and +8 B for the test
# that stops a SUCCESSFUL extraction reporting a memory failure. Paid for many
# times over by the same day's stack re-pricing, which returned 12,272 B —
# but recorded here rather than absorbed, because that is the point of a
# ratchet.
# Raised again 2026-08-31 from 147,296 to 147,424: +128 B to take the
# documents the Finder hands over in AppParmHandle, so an archive dropped on
# the icon extracts. Bought deliberately and with a measured alternative
# refused: CountAppFiles/GetAppFiles are glue rather than traps in the
# Multiversal libraries and cost 344 B for less (DECISIONS.md 2026-08-31,
# *the drop the Finder does not make*). The 512 KB machine, whose Finder has
# no such gesture, pays the 128 B for nothing — which is the trade, stated.
# Raised again 2026-09-01 from 147,424 to 147,588: +164 B for the Apple
# Archive probe, once a reference for the format was found (DECISIONS.md
# 2026-09-01, *the search, not the reference*). Bought on the same terms as
# the rest of the named-only set: one engine, not a Macintosh subset of one.
# Two attempts at making it cheaper are in the probe -- the subtype set is a
# string constant rather than sixteen comparisons, and the length floor is
# one test rather than three -- and they bought 52 B of the 216 the first
# version cost. That 12 % is the figure worth remembering about code shape
# on this target.
# Raised again 2026-09-09 from 147,588 to 149,756: +2,168 B for DART, the
# first format here whose output is a file of its own format (DECISIONS.md
# 2026-09-09). Bought on the same terms as every other format — one engine,
# not a Macintosh subset of one — and the one that most earns it on this
# target: what a compressed DART is FOR is mounting, and MacMount refuses
# one until something expands it.
# Raised 2026-09-18 from 149,756 to 149,832: +76 B for the LZ coders that
# hand their output back a run at a time out of their own windows instead
# of a byte at a time through a pointer, net of 158 B Arsenic gave back by
# writing through the fork writer (DECISIONS.md 2026-09-18). A first
# version cost 468 B; a flush is a loop and a call, and one site per coder
# was the difference. Bought for −2.4 to −9.4 % of instructions on the
# formats that use them.
UNC_MAC_MAX_CODE=${UNC_MAC_MAX_CODE:-149832}
# The A5 ratchet, added 2026-09-02 with the measurement that made it
# necessary: 16,384 B of .data cost 16,418 B of budget, so data is not free
# and never was (FORMATS.md, *What the application costs the engine*; the
# withdrawn claim is in BLOCKERS.md). Set at the size on the day, like the
# code ceiling: 44,096 B = 32,644 data + 11,452 bss. It had grown unwatched
# the whole time this file said data was free.
# Raised 2026-09-09 from 44,096 to 44,260: +164 B for DART, attributed by
# diffing the linked image's .data symbols — 28 B of type table, 20 B of
# format row, 4 B of probe pointer, 4 B on unc_strerror's switch table, and
# ~100 B of message text. The type table was 56 B in the first draft and
# holds one DIGIT per row instead of a whole OSType, which cost 8 B of code
# to save 24 B here: on this target both come off the same budget, so that
# is 16 B, and it is the second time composing a constant beat storing it
# (DECISIONS.md 2026-09-01, *two byte reads*).
